Investors want to see scalable, repeatable success, yet setting up analytics, building a CRM, and structuring outreach takes time—time you don’t have. Hiring a full-time marketing team is expensive and premature, leaving many startups with scattered efforts, struggling to prove traction and scale efficiently.
